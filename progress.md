Day 01 (Sept 15, 2025):
- Set up Git repo structure.
- Learned COBOL program structure (IDENTIFICATION, DATA, PROCEDURE divisions).
- Practiced first COBOL program (addition of two numbers).
- Explored Picture Clause (9, X, A, S9, V, P, Z, $).
- Understood rules for DISPLAY, ACCEPT, and statement termination.

Day 02 (Sept 16, 2025):
- Studied ISO 8583 (financial transaction messaging) flow chart from ppt
- Understood authorization vs settlement vs adjustment.
- Learned ACH payment flow & clearing house role.
- Researched and studied about transaction lifecycle (hold, debit, release).
- Worked and studied Cobol tutorial - 3 parts 

Day 03 (Sept 17, 2025):
- Explored merchant- & bank-level aggregation.
- Understood interchange (issuer ↔ acquirer communication).
- Learned settlement batching (nightly process, millions of txns).
- Studied role of acquirer processors & clearing houses.
- Read about complex batch jobs (8+ hours runtime).
- Worked and studied Cobol tutorial - coded few program (Addition, Calculator)

Day 04 (Sept 18, 2025):
- Learned about failover & fault tolerance (primary ↔ backup processes).
- understood checkpointing (resume from save point).
- Explored causes of failure: hardware, memory, deadlock, I/O errors.
- Reviewed system layers: hardware → Guardian OS → Enscribe → TMF → Pathway → Apps.
- Learned key terms: High Availability (99.999%), Disaster Recovery, Parallel Processing.
- Began an Udmey Cobol course and did introduction and setup

Day 05 (Sept 19, 2025):
- Learned HP NonStop architecture layers: Hardware → Guardian/OSS OS → Enscribe/SQL DB → TMF → Middleware (Pathway) → Applications (COBOL/C).
- Understood fault tolerance & high availability (99.999%) → no single point of failure, ~5 min downtime/year.
- Studied linear scalability & shared nothing architecture → add CPUs to handle more TPS without bottlenecks.
- Explored process pairs & checkpointing → primary ↔ backup sync, failover detection → promotion → recovery.
- Working and following along with the Udmey course
